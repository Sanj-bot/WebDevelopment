        <h2>Cats</h2>
        <p>
          Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.
          <br />
          Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are
          much better than that of humans. <br />
          Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four
          toes on each back paw). <br />
          Cats can jump up to six times their length.

          The French Bulldog was first named the most popular breed in 2022.
          <br />
          The name Collie means “black.” (Collies once tended black-faced
          sheep.) <br />
          Yawning is contagious — even for dogs. Research shows that the sound
          of a human yawn can trigger one from your dog. And it’s four times as
          likely to happen when it’s the yawn of a person your pet knows.
